Assignment Management System (A.M.S.)

Developed in C.

A.M.S. is a console based program, allowing both students and professors to manage academic assignments.
The system features a user management logic developed from scratch, enabling the system to memorize each user's purpose in the ecosystem.

How does the process work?

On the lower level, when a system is launched for the first time, a user must be created in order to utilize their respective role with the assignments.
In the event that a professor account is created, the professor will be able to select the courses in which they are authorized to manage the assignments.
On the contrary, if a student account is created, the student will need to sign up to the courses that they wish to sign up to for the upcoming semester.

Professor - One of the professor's prominent abilities in the system is to create a new **Assignment**.
Assignments are assigned to a specific course, they contain information about deadlines and current completion status.
When an assignment is created, the system automatically synchronizes the assignment with all the students who decided to sign up for the course that the assignment is in.
After an assignment is already on the system, the responsibility is transferred to the receiving student's hands.
Once the assignment was turned in, only then can a professor grade them for their work (assuming the assignment deadline has not passed).

Student - The student's role in the system is to fulfill the requirements set by the professors who teach the courses they are signed to.
Once an assignment is given to a stuent, it is their role to make sure the assignment is turned in on time.
Once the assignment was turned in, it's only a matter of time until the relevant professor grades them.

Both user types, being students and professors, are able to do multiple actions using the current data in the system which includes sorting by different parameters, searching, filtering by completion status and more.
The system enables the user to instantly save their progress through every step of the program, allowing for mistakes to be easily erasable and cruical data to be easily savable.

The system was written as an assignment for a C course, it was written with utilization of all basic functions of the language in mind.
In turn, this means the program showcases the programmer's ability to keep track of memory and prevent leaks, write clean modular code and utilize the language's strengths.
